This repository contains the implementation of the Gated Graph Neural Networks
for my bachelor thesis "Explainable Predictive Process Monitoring - An evaluation of Gated Graph Neural Networks as a white-box classification model" based on the implementation from [Li et al. 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05493) for learning properties of chemical molecules.

This code was not maintained since handing in my thesis on the 18th of November 2019. During the final evaluations the repository got a little messy...
