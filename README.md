This repository contains the implementation of the Gated Graph Neural Network model for my bachelor thesis "Explainable Predictive Process Monitoring - An evaluation of Gated Graph Neural Networks as a white-box classification model" based on the implementation from [Li et al. 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05493) for learning properties of chemical molecules.

This code was not maintained since handing in my thesis on the 18th of November 2019. During the final evaluations, the repository lost some of its structure.
